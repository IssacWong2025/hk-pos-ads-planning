## Current Status
- Phase 1 complete: Strategy v1 published to HTML and GitHub Pages.

- Phase 3 pending: Tracking and audience quality verification.
- Phase 4 pending: Weekly dashboard and baseline refresh workflow.
- Phase 5 pending: v1.1 release and internal handoff package.

## Scope Lock (Do Not Change Without Explicit Approval)
- Channel: Meta only (Facebook / Instagram)
- Budget month 1: HKD 6,000
- Budget split: 70% consultation lead generation / 30% retargeting
- Market: Hong Kong
- Language: Traditional Chinese only
- Ad delivery window: 09:00-22:00 (HKT)

## Deliverables
- Live plan page: docs/index.html
- Version snapshot: docs/versions/*.html
- Change notes: CHANGELOG.md

## Definition of Done per Phase
- Phase 2 DoD:
  - 3 message angles finalized
  - Each angle has at least 2 creative variants (1:1 and 9:16)
  - Claims boundaries defined (what can/cannot be said)
- Phase 3 DoD:
  - Event definitions mapped to data source (Meta/GA4/Firebase/CRM)
  - Retargeting audiences validated for size and overlap
  - Exclusion logic confirmed
- Phase 4 DoD:
  - Weekly KPI panel fixed (lead volume, valid conversation rate, registration rate, activation rate)
  - stop/scale thresholds numeric and operationalized
- Phase 5 DoD:
  - v1.1 HTML published
  - Changelog updated
  - handoff note added for next session

## Open Questions (Need User Input)
1. Compliance boundary for ad copy claims (cost-saving phrasing limits)
2. Available creative assets inventory (image/video/raw materials)
3. Current data reliability for activation event chain

## Next Session First Actions
1. Confirm copy compliance boundaries and claim-safe wording.
2. Produce the v1.1 copy block and creative brief table.
3. Update docs/index.html + docs/versions snapshot + CHANGELOG.
