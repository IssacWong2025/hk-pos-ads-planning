# Task Plan - HK POS Ads Planning

## Objective
Maintain a leadership-ready month-1 Meta strategy page focused on direction, phased actions, decision gates, and expected outcomes.

## Current Status
- Leadership-view strategy page rewritten to v1.2.1 output style.
- Conversational traces removed from the main page.
- Snapshot file added under docs/versions.

## Scope Lock
- Meta only
- HKD 6,000 month-1 budget
- Hong Kong market
- Traditional Chinese only
- Ad window: 09:00-22:00 HKT

## Leadership Success Criteria
- Hard business goal: 5 effective activations.
- Ad-side pass line: 40-60 consultations (target 50).
- Stage model: cold start -> validation -> scale.
- Review trigger: consultation-volume checkpoint by spend node.

## Next Actions
1. Add explicit spend-node consultation thresholds after user confirms node granularity.
2. Keep weekly leadership summary in one block (direction, phase, result).
3. Continue updates only in leadership output style.
