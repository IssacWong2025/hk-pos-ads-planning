# Task Plan - HK POS Ads Planning

If resumed: read files in this order:
1) task_plan.md
2) findings.md
3) progress.md
4) docs/index.html

## Objective
Deliver a leadership-ready Meta launch strategy that clearly shows direction, phased actions, decision gates, and expected outcomes for month-1 (HKD 6,000).

## Current Status
- Phase 1 complete: v1 initial plan published.
- Phase 2 complete: v1.1 detail refinement published.
- Phase 3 complete: leadership strategy framing confirmed via brainstorming.
- Phase 4 in progress: convert page and planning files to leadership-view execution (v1.2).
- Phase 5 pending: publish/push v1.2 and confirm viewing link.

## Scope Lock (Do Not Change Without Explicit Approval)
- Channel: Meta only (Facebook / Instagram)
- Budget month 1: HKD 6,000
- Budget split: 70% consultation lead generation / 30% retargeting
- Market: Hong Kong
- Language: Traditional Chinese only
- Ad delivery window: 09:00-22:00 (HKT)

## Leadership-Level Success Criteria
- Hard business goal: 5 effective activations in month-1.
- Ad-side pass line: 40-60 consultations in month-1 (target 50).
- Reporting mode: phased milestones (cold start -> validation -> scale), not strict calendar month.
- Review trigger: consultation-volume checkpoint by spend node.

## Deliverables
- Live plan page: docs/index.html (leadership-view v1.2)
- Version snapshot: docs/versions/*.html
- Change notes: CHANGELOG.md

## Open Questions (Need User Input)
1. Spend checkpoint granularity for consultation review (e.g., every HKD 1,500 or HKD 2,000).
2. The minimum consultation count expected at each checkpoint.
3. Weekly cadence for leadership update (which weekday/frequency).

## Next Session First Actions
1. Add explicit spend-node consultation thresholds into the strategy page.
2. Add one-page leadership dashboard block (phase / consultation progress / activation progress).
3. Push and verify GitHub Pages rendering.
