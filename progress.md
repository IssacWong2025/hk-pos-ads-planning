## 2026-02-12
- Resumed from planning-with-files memory:
  - task_plan.md

  - Added v1.1 snapshot in `docs/versions/`
  - Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with v1.1.0 release notes
- Updated planning memory files for session continuity:

## Notes
- A content encoding mismatch caused contextual patch failure once; resolved by full-file replacement.
- Scope lock preserved:
  - Meta only
  - HKD 6,000
  - 70/30 split
  - 09:00-22:00 HKT

## Next Planned Update

3) Validate retargeting audience size/overlap and adjust structure if needed.
