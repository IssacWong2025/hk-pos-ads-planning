# Progress Log - HK POS Ads Planning

## 2026-02-12 (leadership strategy alignment)
- Ran brainstorming flow with user to refocus strategy level.
- Confirmed leadership-view priorities:
  - Hard goal: 5 effective activations in month-1
  - Ad pass line: 40-60 consultations (target 50)
  - Stage model: cold start -> validation -> scale
  - Trigger model: consultation threshold at spend checkpoints
  - ROI: no fixed numeric baseline in month-1

## 2026-02-12 (v1.2 content rewrite)
- Rewrote `docs/index.html` into management-focused strategy page.
- Added version snapshot:
  - `docs/versions/首月HKD6000香港餐飲POSMeta投放規劃.v1.2.管理層版.html`
- Updated planning memory files:
  - task_plan.md
  - findings.md
  - progress.md

## Next Planned Update
1) Add spend-node threshold table to the leadership page.
2) Confirm checkpoint thresholds with user.
3) Publish/push and verify GitHub Pages rendering.
