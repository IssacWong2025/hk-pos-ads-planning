# Findings - HK POS Ads Planning

## Confirmed Direction (via brainstorming)
- Primary purpose of this planning page: show leadership the direction and major strategy after launch.
- Avoid over-detailing execution areas (creative asset details, legal copy micro-rules) in this version.
- Month-1 hard result goal: 5 effective activations.
- Ad-side evaluation baseline: consultation volume first.
- Consultation target range under HKD 6,000: 40-60 consultations (target value: 50).
- Stage model preferred: cold-start -> validation -> scale.
- Review trigger: tied to consultation volume at spend checkpoints (not a strict date trigger).
- ROI numeric threshold: not fixed for month-1 due to no stable baseline.

## Locked Inputs
- Channel: Meta only
- Budget: HKD 6,000
- Budget split: 70% consultation / 30% retargeting
- Time window: 09:00-22:00 (HKT)
- Language: Traditional Chinese only

## Planning Implications
- The strategy page should separate:
  - Ad-direction success (consultation volume)
  - Business success (effective activations)
- Leadership can quickly answer:
  - Are we on consultation trajectory?
  - Are we moving through stages as planned?
  - Are we on pace for 5 activations?

## Pending Inputs
- Spend-node definition for review checkpoints.
- Consultation threshold at each spend node.
- Leadership review rhythm (weekly day/time).
