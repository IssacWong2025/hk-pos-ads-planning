# Findings - HK POS Ads Planning

## Confirmed Direction
- This document is for leadership review, not execution-detail review.
- Main output must show: direction, phased actions, checkpoints, expected outcomes.
- Month-1 hard goal: 5 effective activations.
- Ad-side pass line: 40-60 consultations (target 50) under HKD 6,000 budget.
- No fixed ROI numeric threshold in month-1 due to missing baseline.

## Strategic Framing
- Ad function: stabilize consultation volume.
- Sales/ops function: convert consultations to activation.
- Management decisions should be made by checkpoint signals, not by isolated creative details.

## Pending Inputs
- Spend checkpoint granularity.
- Consultation minimum at each checkpoint.
- Leadership review cadence.
